                <h1>- Alice -</h1>
                <P>Alice is a young girl with shoulder-length blonde hair and striking blue eyes. She usually wears a
                    childish blue Victorian dress. She is shown as ghostly pale like many other English people. Her hair
                    which is as yellow blonde as corn is usually down- showing her curls.</P>

            <li id="bug"> <img src="img/section3/guest/bug.png" alt="Blue Caterpiller">
                <h1>- Caterpiller -</h1>
                <p>The Caterpillar is a blue creature who, as in the original Carroll story, smokes a
                    hookah. He is seen as a very forthright character as he yells at Alice quite often during the scenes
                    in which they both appear. He blows smoke in Alice's face and when she needs assistance he ignores
                    her.</p>

            <li id="cat"> <img src="img/section3/guest/cat.png" alt="Cheshire Cat">
                <h1>- CheshireCat -</h1>
                <p>The Cheshire Cat has a permanent smile on his face and he can disappear at will. He is a very odd
                    being who is able to reshape his body to either amuse or frighten his visitors. He's very
                    mysterious, and in his own way, very dark. Like all members of Wonderland, he is mad, but unlike the
                    others, he admits it with pride.</p>

                <img src="img/section3/guest/hare.png" alt="March Hare">
                <h1>- MarchHare -</h1>
                <p>The March Hare is a character in Disney's 1951 animated feature film, Alice in Wonderland. A wacky,
                    mallet-carrying rabbit, he is a resident of Wonderland and the best friend of the Mad Hatter, with
                    whom the Hare regularly engages in tea and "unbirthday" parties.</p>

                <img src="img/section3/guest/madhatter.png" alt="Madhatter">
                <h1>- MadHatter -</h1>
                <P>As the name suggests, the mad hatter is a seemingly insane character that gives out riddles and
                    dresses fashionably. His obsession with tea time as well as tea parties is a result of trying to
                    sing for the Queen of Hearts where he was found guilty of murdering time.

                <img src="img/section3/guest/mouse.png" alt="Dorm Mouse">
                <h1>- DoreMouse -</h1>
                <p>The character also appears in Disney's Alice in Wonderland. As in the book, he is sleepy and lazy,
                    but unlike in the book, he sings Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat instead of telling his story about
                    mouse sisters to entertain the tea-party participants.</p>

            <li id="rabbit">
                <img src="img/section3/guest/rabbit.png" alt="White rabbit">
                <h1>- WhiteRabbit -</h1>
                <p>The White Rabbit is the first creature Alice sees, anxiously running into the rabbit hole in order to
                    not be late. He is a very distinguished rabbit, with a large house and a gardener and always wearing
                    gloves, a waistcoat and a pocket watch, but he is always in a hurry.
                </p>

                <img src="img/section3/guest/redqueen.png" alt="Red Queen">
                <h1>- RedQueen -</h1>
                <p>She is very strict and a bit cold. She attempts to teach Alice life lessons and how to be an adequate
                    "queen". She can be rather bossy and rude, but not nearly does she have the same cruel reputation as
                    the Queen Of Hearts.</p>

            <li id="white">
                <img src="img/section3/guest/whitequeen.png" alt="White Queen">
                <h1>- WhiteQueen -</h1>
                <p>The White Queen is an absent-minded, unkempt, anxious woman. In fact, every time Alice encounters the
                    White Queen, Alice needs to take care of her â€“ either helping her get to her crying child, fixing
                    her shawl and hair, or patting her on the head and singing her a lullaby.</p>
