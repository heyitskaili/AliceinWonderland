        <h1>Back Story</h1>

        <div class="container4">
            <p id="section5p">The story centres on Alice, a young girl who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows the
                White Rabbit down a rabbit hole. She has many wondrous, often bizarre adventures with thoroughly
                illogical and very strange creatures, often changing size unexpectedly. She encounters the
                hookah-smoking Caterpillar, the Duchess, and the Cheshire Cat, and she attends a strange endless tea
                party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. She plays a game of croquet with an unmanageable flamingo
                for a croquet mallet and uncooperative hedgehogs for croquet balls while the Queen calls for the
                execution of almost everyone present. Later, at the Queen’s behest, the Gryphon takes Alice to meet the
                sobbing Mock Turtle, who describes his education in such subjects as Ambition, Distraction,
                Uglification, and Derision. Alice is then called as a witness in the trial of the Knave of Hearts, who
                is accused of having stolen the Queen’s tarts. However, when the Queen demands that Alice be beheaded,
                Alice realizes that the characters are only a pack of cards, and she then awakens from her dream.</p>
