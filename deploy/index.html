                                <P>Alice is a young girl with shoulder-length blonde hair and striking blue eyes. She usually wears a
                                    childish blue Victorian dress. She is shown as ghostly pale like many other English people. Her hair
                                    which is as yellow blonde as corn is usually down- showing her curls.</P>

                                <p>The Caterpillar is a blue creature who, as in the original Carroll story, smokes a
                                    hookah. He is seen as a very forthright character as he yells at Alice quite often during the scenes
                                    in which they both appear. He blows smoke in Alice's face and when she needs assistance he ignores
                                    her.</p>

                                <p>The Cheshire Cat has a permanent smile on his face and he can disappear at will. He is a very odd
                                    being who is able to reshape his body to either amuse or frighten his visitors. He's very
                                    mysterious, and in his own way, very dark. Like all members of Wonderland, he is mad, but unlike the
                                    others, he admits it with pride.</p>

                                <p>The March Hare is a character in Disney's 1951 animated feature film, Alice in Wonderland. A wacky,
                                    mallet-carrying rabbit, he is a resident of Wonderland and the best friend of the Mad Hatter, with
                                    whom the Hare regularly engages in tea and "unbirthday" parties.</p>

                                <P>As the name suggests, the mad hatter is a seemingly insane character that gives out riddles and
                                    dresses fashionably. His obsession with tea time as well as tea parties is a result of trying to
                                    sing for the Queen of Hearts where he was found guilty of murdering time.

                                    but unlike in the book, he sings Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat instead of telling his story about
                                    mouse sisters to entertain the tea-party participants.</p>

                                <p>The White Rabbit is the first creature Alice sees, anxiously running into the rabbit hole in order to
                                    not be late. He is a very distinguished rabbit, with a large house and a gardener and always wearing
                                    gloves, a waistcoat and a pocket watch, but he is always in a hurry.

                                <p>She is very strict and a bit cold. She attempts to teach Alice life lessons and how to be an adequate
                                    "queen". She can be rather bossy and rude, but not nearly does she have the same cruel reputation as
                                    the Queen Of Hearts.</p>

                                <p>The White Queen is an absent-minded, unkempt, anxious woman. In fact, every time Alice encounters the
                                    White Queen, Alice needs to take care of her – either helping her get to her crying child, fixing
                                    her shawl and hair, or patting her on the head and singing her a lullaby.</p>

                                        White Rabbit down a rabbit hole. She has many wondrous, often bizarre adventures with thoroughly
                                        illogical and very strange creatures, often changing size unexpectedly. She encounters the
                                        hookah-smoking Caterpillar, the Duchess, and the Cheshire Cat, and she attends a strange endless tea
                                        party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. She plays a game of croquet with an unmanageable flamingo
                                        for a croquet mallet and uncooperative hedgehogs for croquet balls while the Queen calls for the
                                        execution of almost everyone present. Later, at the Queen’s behest, the Gryphon takes Alice to meet the
                                        sobbing Mock Turtle, who describes his education in such subjects as Ambition, Distraction,
                                        Uglification, and Derision. Alice is then called as a witness in the trial of the Knave of Hearts, who
                                        is accused of having stolen the Queen’s tarts. However, when the Queen demands that Alice be beheaded,
                                        Alice realizes that the characters are only a pack of cards, and she then awakens from her dream.</p>
